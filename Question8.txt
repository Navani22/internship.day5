Q.8. What can be done using one type of loop can also be done by using other two type of loops ? True/False

Ans: Yes, It is often true that any computation that can be done using one type of loop can 
also be accomplished using another type of loop,
the only difference is in the syntax and the conditions under which the loops operate.
